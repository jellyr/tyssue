'''
An epithelial sheet, i.e a 2D mesh in a 2D or 3D space,
akin to a HalfEdge data structure in CGAL.

For purely 2D the geometric properties are defined in `tyssue.geometry.planar_geometry`
A dynamical model derived from Fahradifar et al. 2007 is provided in
`tyssue.dynamics.planar_vertex_model`


For 2D in 3D, the geometric properties are defined in `tyssue.geometry.sheet_geometry`
A dynamical model derived from Fahradifar et al. 2007 is provided in

        Creates an epithelium sheet, such as the apical junction network.

        ----------

        Return a triangulation of an epithelial sheet (2D in a 3D space),

        ----------
        coords: list of str:
